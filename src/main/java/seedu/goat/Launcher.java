 * {@link Application} itself. Launching an {@code Application} subclass directly makes
 * the JVM insist that the JavaFX modules be on the module path, which fails with
 * "JavaFX runtime components are missing" when the JAR puts them on the classpath
 * instead. A plain class has no such requirement, so this one starts the application
 * on the other's behalf.
